This application is very simple to use. You simply go to http://52.33.88.132:5000

Then it will give you an alert. You hit enter to get to the first query. Then it will ask for an input number. That number will be how many numbers of the FIbonacci sequence you want. You simply enter that in, then hit okay. Then it will generate and display the fibonacci sequence up to that numberof numbers.
